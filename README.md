# Group Agreement

## Meetings
### Times:
Wednesday 1-4pm / 5pm
Friday 4pm

### Recording of meetings:
Luigi and Jac will record the events during each meeting. 
Notes will be documented in Gitlab under ./Meeting-Notes directory.

## Tasks
### How tasks will be allocated:
On GitLab, we will create issues for the requirements outlined in the requirements document. In a meeting,
we will allocate each person to each issue.

### What information will be stored:
* Team agreement
* Meeting Notes
* Work hours and what you've been working on.

### How will progress and delays be reported:
During each meeting, we go over current issues we are working in and our progress/delays through them (SCRUM-style).

## Management of schedule
### Hours expected:
We are expected to do at least 7-8 hours of work per week in the project.

### How:
The schedule is outlined on an excel sheet. When somebody has done work, they will update the shared sheet, and commit 
a message on GitLab.

### Handling variations to the schedule:
When there is a delay, we outline it in a meeting, and try and move people to help with that task. In the schedule,
we will create a duplicate with a new timeline and move future time targets around.

## Coding agreement
### Branching
Each branch needs to relate to an issue. We must not commit straight to main without a commit. When merging to main,

the user requires at least two approval/review.
